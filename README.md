In this Guided Project on Dataquest I've explore births in the U.S.
The dataset was compiled by FiveThirtyEight and you can find it <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv'>here</a>

The dataset contains the following columns:

year: Year (1994 to 2003).
month: Month (1 to 12).
date_of_month: Day number of the month (1 to 31).
day_of_week: Day of week (1 to 7).
births: Number of births that day.
